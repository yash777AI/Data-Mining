	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652583.3657600

      - Focus: Examine how multi-modal data is handled, particularly the fusion of text and image data. The methods for handling and mining information from combined text-image datasets could provide a useful framework if our project will analyze multi-modal data.

   - Prompt Learning for Multi-modal COVID-19 Diagnosis

	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9995157

      - Focus: This paper offer insights into mining data from multiple sources (e.g., text + medical images). Look for any pre-processing and feature extraction strategies used to integrate multi-modal data into a single framework for clustering or classification.


For each paper, extract the data mining techniques, preprocessing steps, and any clustering or classification methods discussed.

Identify whether there are commonalities across papers (e.g., clustering algorithms, feature extraction techniques) that could be used as a base for our project.

Decide which papers provide the most relevant data mining workflows. For example, if multi-modal data mining is what we are going to work on, the medical or text-image papers will be valuable for adapting those techniques.
